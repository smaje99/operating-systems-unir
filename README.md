# Operating Systems (UNIR)

This repository is part of the "Operating Systems" course at UNIR (Universidad Internacional de La Rioja).

## Process Scheduling Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of various process scheduling algorithms commonly used in operating systems. The included algorithms are:

- [First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling Algorithm](scheduling/cfcs_schedule.py)
- [Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling Algorithm](sfj_schedule.py)
- [Priority Scheduling Algorithm](priority_schedule.py)

Each implementation is designed to be educational and comprehensible, demonstrating how each algorithm functions in a simulated environment.

### Usage

Each implementation is contained in its own Python file. You can run them directly to see how they work or integrate them into your own projects.

#### Usage Example:

Run the FCFS Scheduling Algorithm

```bash
python scheduling/cfcs_schedule.py
```

Run the SFJ Scheduling Algorithm

```bash
python scheduling/sfj_schedule.py
```

Run the Priority Scheduling Algorithm

```bash
python scheduling/priority_schedule.py
```

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to improve an existing implementation or add a new process scheduling algorithm, feel free to open a pull request.
